This is a demo text file for testing the file encryption system.

The file contains:
- Multiple lines of text
- Special characters: !@#$%^&*()
- Numbers: 1234567890
- Unicode: 🚀 🔐 📁

This file can be used to test:
1. File upload functionality
2. Encryption process
3. Decryption process
4. File preview feature

The encryption system uses RSA-OAEP with 2048-bit keys and stores private keys securely in IndexedDB with password-based encryption using PBKDF2 and AES-GCM.

This ensures maximum security for your files while maintaining ease of use.
